# AWS Container Platform Comparison

## Customer Challenge

*"The customer has developed a containerized application but faces difficulties deploying it in a manner that delivers both **scalability** and **high availability**. They require a solution that can **automatically scale to meet variable demand**, distribute workloads efficiently across resources, and provides **protection against common web exploits**. Their current architecture lacks **elasticity and resilience**, resulting in **degraded performance during peak usage periods** and increased risk of **service downtime**."*

This project addresses these exact customer pain points through a web application that provides comprehensive analysis and implementation of containerized applications across multiple AWS platforms, evaluating cost efficiency, performance characteristics, and operational complexity.

| Platform | Monthly Cost | Use Case | ROI Benefit |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| **ECS Fargate** | $0.61 | Development, Variable Workloads | 94% cost reduction vs EKS |
| **ECS on EC2** | $1.08 | Production, Predictable Traffic | Baseline for comparison |
| **Plain EC2** | $1.08 | Legacy Migration, Learning | Same cost, maximum control |
| **EKS** | $10.33 | Enterprise, Advanced Orchestration | Justified for K8s-specific needs |

**Cost Optimization Insight:** For workloads under 55% sustained utilization, Fargate delivers 43% cost savings compared to EC2-based solutions while eliminating infrastructure management overhead.

## Technical Deep Dive

### Performance Analysis

The application provides real-time visualization of container performance metrics, demonstrating practical monitoring implementation:

**Resource Efficiency Findings:**
- **ECS Fargate**: 0.001635% avg CPU utilization - exceptional resource optimization
- **ECS on EC2**: 0.000851% avg CPU utilization - container orchestration benefits evident  
- **Plain EC2**: 0.472% avg CPU utilization - 555x higher due to OS overhead
- **EKS**: 2.84% avg CPU utilization - Kubernetes control plane overhead quantified

These metrics demonstrate hands-on experience with CloudWatch monitoring, performance optimization, and capacity planning—critical skills for AWS solutions architecture roles.

### Architecture & Implementation

- Consider EKS only when Kubernetes-specific features are required

**Cost Optimization Strategy:**
- Use Fargate for variable, unpredictable workloads
- Deploy ECS on EC2 with Spot instances for batch processing
- Reserve capacity for predictable production workloads

**Migration Path:**
1. **Phase 1**: Containerize applications with ECS Fargate
2. **Phase 2**: Optimize costs by migrating high-utilization workloads to EC2
3. **Phase 3**: Evaluate EKS for advanced orchestration needs
